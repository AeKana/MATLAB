# Background

In a historical study by John Ridley Stroop, he demonstrated the interference effect with an individuals’ ability to effectively name the colour of the printed word while suppressing the automatic response of reading the word (e.g. the word “RED” printed in blue ink) (Stroop, 1935) commonly, known as the Stroop Effect. What is happening is that we are being confronted with conflicting stimuli – the color and the word. As a result, we try to consciously suppress the word and respond to the color. But this takes an attentional effort and requires a finite amount of processing time that is unavoidable – hence the Stroop Effect. This difference was attributed to the automaticity of the brain as a result of practiced reading while identifying colours and pictures required a more conscious effort (Cattel , 1886).
